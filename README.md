Here’s an example of a `README.md` file that explains how to set up and run the Flask-based flight booking project:

### `README.md`

```markdown
# Flight Booking System

This is a simple flight booking system built using Flask, which allows users to search for flights based on a time input. The system will show all flights that are within a 1-hour range of the time provided by the user.

## Features
- **Search Flights by Time**: Users can input a time in `HH:MM` format, and the system will display flights within a 1-hour window around that time.
- **Flight Data**: The flight details (flight number, origin, destination, price, and time) are hardcoded into the application for demonstration purposes.
- **Flask Backend**: The backend is built using Python and Flask.
- **HTML Frontend**: The user interface is built using HTML with a simple form to input the desired time.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd flight-booking-project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
This project requires Flask. Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` includes:

```
Flask==2.2.2
```

### 3. Run the Application
Start the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will run the server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### 4. Access the Web App
Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You will see a form to input the time. After entering the time in `HH:MM` format, the page will display all the flights that are within 1 hour of that time.

### 5. Flight Data
The flight data is hardcoded in the `app.py` file. The data includes flight details such as flight numbers, departure and arrival locations, prices, and times.

### 6. Making Changes
You can modify the `flights_data` in the `app.py` file, or replace it with data from an external JSON file by reading the file in the backend.

## Example Usage

- **Input**: `14:10`
- **Output**: Flights within an hour of `14:10` will be displayed on the page. For example:

    ```
    Flight No: 6e6011, From: CBE, To: Chennai, Price: ₹3605, Time: 14:10
    Flight No: ai539, From: CBE, To: Chennai, Price: ₹4209, Time: 15:10
    ```
